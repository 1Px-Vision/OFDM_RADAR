# OFDM_RADAR

Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM)--based radar systems have shown capabilities comparable to traditional Linear Frequency Modulated (LFM) radar systems in range, velocity estimation, and image generation. These advanced radar systems are utilized in various fields, including traffic monitoring, unmanned vehicles, and robotic vision. The inherent orthogonality of OFDM signals 
permits simultaneous transmission from multiple antennas via spectral division, enhancing system efficiency.

# Advantages of OFDM in Radar Systems
Adopting OFDM in radar systems offers significant improvements over LFM-modulated systems, particularly in spatial resolution. These enhancements are achieved through:

* Space Diversity: Utilization of Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) array antennas.
* Controlled Bandwidth: Enabling better control over the transmission spectrum.
* Reduced Range Ambiguity: Incorporation of a cyclic prefix (CP) to mitigate range ambiguity.
