# OFDM_RADAR

Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM)--based radar systems have shown capabilities comparable to traditional Linear Frequency Modulated (LFM) radar systems in range, velocity estimation, and image generation. These advanced radar systems are utilized in various fields, including traffic monitoring, unmanned vehicles, and robotic vision. The inherent orthogonality of OFDM signals 
permits simultaneous transmission from multiple antennas via spectral division, enhancing system efficiency.

# Advantages of OFDM in Radar Systems
Adopting OFDM in radar systems offers significant improvements over LFM-modulated systems, particularly in spatial resolution. These enhancements are achieved through:

* **Space Diversity:** Utilization of Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) array antennas.
* **Controlled Bandwidth:** Enabling better control over the transmission spectrum.
* **Reduced Range Ambiguity:** Incorporation of a cyclic prefix (CP) to mitigate range ambiguity.

> [!TIP]
> The integration of OFDM in microwave imaging systems markedly improves resolution and aperture synthesis, making it a superior choice for high-precision applications.

# Project Scope

This project presents the development of a cost-effective OFDM radar system employing multi-carrier in-band S technology in a 1x2 MIMO configuration. The system focuses on generating 2D images using the Range Doppler Algorithm (RDA), with enhanced spatial resolution achieved through carrier control and phase adjustment.

# Application in Unmanned Ground Vehicles

The proposed radar system is designed explicitly for Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV) applications. It employs a virtual antenna technique to extend the antenna aperture, thereby covering a more effective measurement area. This approach ensures a broader and more detailed coverage, essential for the navigation and operation of UGVs in complex environments.
